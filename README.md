Super useless linux commands ;)
# Version 1.0.0
The first version!

With a greeter when you open your terminal.

And commands such as

```greeter``` if you want to be greeted again

```gen-motd``` for resetting motd list, the installer does NOT run this, if you want a new motd list then run this command.

```motd``` gives you a random message from the motd list

```hello``` prints ```Hello, World!``` to the terminal with an animation and a random color, you can use ```hello "<custom message>"``` for a custom message.
